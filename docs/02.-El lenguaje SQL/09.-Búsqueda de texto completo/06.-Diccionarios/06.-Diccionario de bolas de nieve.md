The Snowball dictionary template is  based on a project by Martin Porter, inventor of the popular Porter's  stemming algorithm for the English language. Snowball now provides  stemming algorithms for many languages (see the [Snowball site](https://snowballstem.org/) for more information). Each algorithm understands how to reduce common  variant forms of words to a base, or stem, spelling within its language. A Snowball dictionary requires a `language` parameter to identify which stemmer to use, and optionally can specify a `stopword` file name that gives a list of words to eliminate. (PostgreSQL's standard stopword lists are also provided by the Snowball project.) For example, there is a built-in definition equivalent to

```
CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_stem (
    TEMPLATE = snowball,
    Language = english,
    StopWords = english
);
```

The stopword file format is the same as already explained.

A Snowball dictionary recognizes everything, whether or not it is able to simplify the word, so it  should be placed at the end of the dictionary list. It is useless to  have it before any other dictionary because a token will never pass  through it to the next dictionary.
