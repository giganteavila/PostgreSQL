Stop words are words that are very common, appear in almost every  document, and have no discrimination value. Therefore, they can be  ignored in the context of full text searching. For example, every  English text contains words like `a` and `the`, so it is useless to store them in an index. However, stop words do affect the positions in `tsvector`, which in turn affect ranking:

```
SELECT to_tsvector('english', 'in the list of stop words');
        to_tsvector
----------------------------
 'list':3 'stop':5 'word':6
```

The missing positions 1,2,4 are because of stop words. Ranks  calculated for documents with and without stop words are quite  different:

```
SELECT ts_rank_cd (to_tsvector('english', 'in the list of stop words'), to_tsquery('list & stop'));
 ts_rank_cd
------------
       0.05

SELECT ts_rank_cd (to_tsvector('english', 'list stop words'), to_tsquery('list & stop'));
 ts_rank_cd
------------
        0.1
```

It is up to the specific dictionary how it treats stop words. For example, `ispell` dictionaries first normalize words and then look at the list of stop words, while `Snowball` stemmers first check the list of stop words. The reason for the different behavior is an attempt to decrease noise.
