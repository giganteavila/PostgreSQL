An index can be defined on more than one column of a table. For example, if you have a table of this form:

```
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);
```

(say, you keep your `/dev` directory in a database...) and you frequently issue queries like:

```
SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = constant AND minor = constant;
```

then it might be appropriate to define an index on the columns `major` and `minor` together, e.g.:

```
CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);
```

Currently, only the B-tree, GiST, GIN, and BRIN index types support multiple-key-column indexes. Whether there can be multiple key columns  is independent of whether `INCLUDE` columns can be added to the index. Indexes can have up to 32 columns, including `INCLUDE` columns. (This limit can be altered when building PostgreSQL; see the file `pg_config_manual.h`.)

A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that  involve any subset of the index's columns, but the index is most  efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns.  The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an  equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned. Constraints on columns to the right of these columns are  checked in the index, so they save visits to the table proper, but they  do not reduce the portion of the index that has to be scanned. For  example, given an index on `(a, b, c)` and a query condition `WHERE a = 5 AND b >= 42 AND c < 77`, the index would have to be scanned from the first entry with `a` = 5 and `b` = 42 up through the last entry with `a` = 5. Index entries with `c` >= 77 would be skipped, but they'd still have to be scanned through. This index could in principle be used for queries that have constraints on `b` and/or `c` with no constraint on `a` â€” but the entire index would have to be scanned, so in most cases the  planner would prefer a sequential table scan over using the index.

A multicolumn GiST index can be used with query conditions that  involve any subset of the index's columns. Conditions on additional  columns restrict the entries returned by the index, but the condition on the first column is the most important one for determining how much of  the index needs to be scanned. A GiST index will be relatively  ineffective if its first column has only a few distinct values, even if  there are many distinct values in additional columns.

A multicolumn GIN index can be used with query conditions that  involve any subset of the index's columns. Unlike B-tree or GiST, index  search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index column(s) the query conditions use.

A multicolumn BRIN index can be used with query conditions that  involve any subset of the index's columns. Like GIN and unlike B-tree or GiST, index search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index  column(s) the query conditions use. The only reason to have multiple  BRIN indexes instead of one multicolumn BRIN index on a single table is  to have a different `pages_per_range` storage parameter.

Of course, each column must be used with operators appropriate to  the index type; clauses that involve other operators will not be  considered.

Multicolumn indexes should be used sparingly. In most situations,  an index on a single column is sufficient and saves space and time.  Indexes with more than three columns are unlikely to be helpful unless  the usage of the table is extremely stylized.
