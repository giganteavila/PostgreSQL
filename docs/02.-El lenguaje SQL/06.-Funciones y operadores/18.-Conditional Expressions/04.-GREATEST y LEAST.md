```
GREATEST(value [, ...])
LEAST(value [, ...])
```

The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions select the largest or smallest value from a list of any  number of expressions. The expressions must all be convertible to a  common data type, which will be the type of the result (see [Section 10.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/typeconv-union-case.html) for details).

NULL values in the argument list are ignored. The result will be  NULL only if all the expressions evaluate to NULL. (This is a deviation  from the SQL standard. According to the standard, the return value is  NULL if any argument is NULL. Some other databases behave this way.)
