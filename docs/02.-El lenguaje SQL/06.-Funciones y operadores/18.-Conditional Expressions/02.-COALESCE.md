```
COALESCE(value [, ...])
```

The `COALESCE` function returns the  first of its arguments that is not null. Null is returned only if all  arguments are null. It is often used to substitute a default value for  null values when data is retrieved for display, for example:

```
SELECT COALESCE(description, short_description, '(none)') ...
```

This returns `description` if it is not null, otherwise `short_description` if it is not null, otherwise `(none)`.

The arguments must all be convertible to a common data type, which will be the type of the result (see [Section 10.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/typeconv-union-case.html) for details).

Like a `CASE` expression, `COALESCE` only evaluates the arguments that are needed to determine the result;  that is, arguments to the right of the first non-null argument are not  evaluated. This SQL-standard function provides capabilities similar to `NVL` and `IFNULL`, which are used in some other database systems.
