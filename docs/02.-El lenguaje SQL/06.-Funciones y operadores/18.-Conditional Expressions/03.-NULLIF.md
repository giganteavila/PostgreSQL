```
NULLIF(value1, value2)
```

The `NULLIF` function returns a null value if *`value1`* equals *`value2`*; otherwise it returns *`value1`*. This can be used to perform the inverse operation of the `COALESCE` example given above:

```
SELECT NULLIF(value, '(none)') ...
```

In this example, if `value` is `(none)`, null is returned, otherwise the value of `value` is returned.

The two arguments must be of comparable types. To be specific, they are compared exactly as if you had written `*`value1`* = *`value2`*`, so there must be a suitable `=` operator available.

The result has the same type as the first argument â€” but there is a subtlety. What is actually returned is the first argument of the  implied `=` operator, and in some cases that will have been promoted to match the second argument's type. For example, `NULLIF(1, 2.2)` yields `numeric`, because there is no `integer` `=` `numeric` operator, only `numeric` `=` `numeric`.
