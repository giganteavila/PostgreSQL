This section describes the SQL-compliant conditional expressions available in PostgreSQL.

### Tip

If your needs go beyond the capabilities of these conditional  expressions, you might want to consider writing a server-side function  in a more expressive programming language.

### Note

Although `COALESCE`, `GREATEST`, and `LEAST` are syntactically similar to functions, they are not ordinary functions, and thus cannot be used with explicit `VARIADIC` array arguments.
