*Aggregate functions* compute a single result from a set of input values. The built-in general-purpose aggregate functions are listed in [Table 9.59](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-TABLE) while statistical aggregates are in [Table 9.60](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-STATISTICS-TABLE). The built-in within-group ordered-set aggregate functions are listed in [Table 9.61](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-ORDEREDSET-TABLE) while the built-in within-group hypothetical-set ones are in [Table 9.62](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-HYPOTHETICAL-TABLE). Grouping operations, which are closely related to aggregate functions, are listed in [Table 9.63](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-GROUPING-TABLE). The special syntax considerations for aggregate functions are explained in [Section 4.2.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-AGGREGATES). Consult [Section 2.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-agg.html) for additional introductory information.

Aggregate functions that support *Partial Mode* are eligible to participate in various optimizations, such as parallel aggregation.

If `ABSENT ON NULL` is specified, any NULL values are omitted. If `ORDER BY` is specified, the elements will appear in the array in that order rather than in the input order.              `SELECT json_arrayagg(v) FROM (VALUES(2),(1)) t(v)` → `[2, 1]` | No           |
| `json_object_agg_unique_strict` ( *`key`* `"any"`, *`value`* `"any"` ) → `json`               `jsonb_object_agg_unique_strict` ( *`key`* `"any"`, *`value`* `"any"` ) → `jsonb`              Collects all the key/value pairs into a JSON object.

| `min` ( *`see text`* ) → `*`same as input type`*`              Computes the minimum of the non-null input values. Available for any numeric, string, date/time, or enum type, as well as `inet`, `interval`, `money`, `oid`, `pg_lsn`, `tid`, `xid8`, and arrays of any of these types. | Yes          |
| `range_agg` ( *`value`* `anyrange` ) → `anymultirange`              `range_agg` ( *`value`* `anymultirange` ) → `anymultirange`              Computes the union of the non-null input values. | No           |
| `range_intersect_agg` ( *`value`* `anyrange` ) → `anyrange`              `range_intersect_agg` ( *`value`* `anymultirange` ) → `anymultirange`              Computes the intersection of the non-null input values. | No           |
| `json_agg_strict` ( `anyelement` ) → `json`               `jsonb_agg_strict` ( `anyelement` ) → `jsonb`              Collects all the input values, skipping nulls, into a JSON array. Values are converted to JSON as per `to_json` or `to_jsonb`. | No           |
| `string_agg` ( *`value`* `text`, *`delimiter`* `text` ) → `text`              `string_agg` ( *`value`* `bytea`, *`delimiter`* `bytea` ) → `bytea`              Concatenates the non-null input values into a string. Each value after the first is preceded by the corresponding *`delimiter`* (if it's not null). | Yes          |
| `sum` ( `smallint` ) → `bigint`              `sum` ( `integer` ) → `bigint`              `sum` ( `bigint` ) → `numeric`              `sum` ( `numeric` ) → `numeric`              `sum` ( `real` ) → `real`              `sum` ( `double precision` ) → `double precision`              `sum` ( `interval` ) → `interval`              `sum` ( `money` ) → `money`              Computes the sum of the non-null input values. | Yes          |
| `xmlagg` ( `xml` ) → `xml`              Concatenates the non-null XML input values (see [Section 9.15.1.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-xml.html#FUNCTIONS-XML-XMLAGG)). | No           |

It should be noted that except for `count`, these functions return a null value when no rows are selected. In particular, `sum` of no rows returns null, not zero as one might expect, and `array_agg` returns null rather than an empty array when there are no input rows. The `coalesce` function can be used to substitute zero or an empty array for null when necessary.

The aggregate functions `array_agg`, `json_agg`, `jsonb_agg`, `json_agg_strict`, `jsonb_agg_strict`, `json_object_agg`, `jsonb_object_agg`, `json_object_agg_strict`, `jsonb_object_agg_strict`, `json_object_agg_unique`, `jsonb_object_agg_unique`, `json_object_agg_unique_strict`, `jsonb_object_agg_unique_strict`, `string_agg`, and `xmlagg`, as well as similar user-defined aggregate functions, produce  meaningfully different result values depending on the order of the input values. This ordering is unspecified by default, but can be controlled  by writing an `ORDER BY` clause within the aggregate call, as shown in [Section 4.2.7](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-AGGREGATES). Alternatively, supplying the input values from a sorted subquery will usually work. For example:

```
SELECT xmlagg(x) FROM (SELECT x FROM test ORDER BY y DESC) AS tab;
```

Beware that this approach can fail if the outer query level  contains additional processing, such as a join, because that might cause the subquery's output to be reordered before the aggregate is computed.

### Note



The boolean aggregates `bool_and` and `bool_or` correspond to the standard SQL aggregates `every` and `any` or `some`. PostgreSQL supports `every`, but not `any` or `some`, because there is an ambiguity built into the standard syntax:

```
SELECT b1 = ANY((SELECT b2 FROM t2 ...)) FROM t1 ...;
```

Here `ANY` can be considered either  as introducing a subquery, or as being an aggregate function, if the  subquery returns one row with a Boolean value. Thus the standard name  cannot be given to these aggregates.

### Note

Users accustomed to working with other SQL database management systems might be disappointed by the performance of the `count` aggregate when it is applied to the entire table. A query like:

```
SELECT count(*) FROM sometable;
```

will require effort proportional to the size of the table: PostgreSQL will need to scan either the entire table or the entirety of an index that includes all rows in the table.

[Table 9.60](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-AGGREGATE-STATISTICS-TABLE) shows aggregate functions typically used in statistical analysis.  (These are separated out merely to avoid cluttering the listing of  more-commonly-used aggregates.) Functions shown as accepting *`numeric_type`* are available for all the types `smallint`, `integer`, `bigint`, `numeric`, `real`, and `double precision`. Where the description mentions *`N`*, it means the number of input rows for which all the input expressions  are non-null. In all cases, null is returned if the computation is  meaningless, for example when *`N`* is zero.

[Table 9.61](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-ORDEREDSET-TABLE) shows some aggregate functions that use the *ordered-set aggregate* syntax. These functions are sometimes referred to as “inverse distribution” functions. Their aggregated input is introduced by `ORDER BY`, and they may also take a *direct argument* that is not aggregated, but is computed only once. All these functions  ignore null values in their aggregated input. For those that take a *`fraction`* parameter, the fraction value must be between 0 and 1; an error is thrown if not. However, a null *`fraction`* value simply produces a null result.



**Table 9.61. Ordered-Set Aggregate Functions**

| Function              Description                            | Partial Mode |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `mode` () `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `anyelement` ) → `anyelement`              Computes the *mode*, the most  frequent value of the aggregated argument (arbitrarily choosing the  first one if there are multiple equally-frequent values). The aggregated argument must be of a sortable type. | No           |
| `percentile_cont` ( *`fraction`* `double precision` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `double precision` ) → `double precision`              `percentile_cont` ( *`fraction`* `double precision` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `interval` ) → `interval`              Computes the *continuous percentile*, a value corresponding to the specified *`fraction`* within the ordered set of aggregated argument values. This will interpolate between adjacent input items if needed. | No           |
| `percentile_cont` ( *`fractions`* `double precision[]` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `double precision` ) → `double precision[]`              `percentile_cont` ( *`fractions`* `double precision[]` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `interval` ) → `interval[]`              Computes multiple continuous percentiles. The result is an array of the same dimensions as the *`fractions`* parameter, with each non-null element replaced by the (possibly interpolated) value corresponding to that percentile. | No           |
| `percentile_disc` ( *`fraction`* `double precision` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `anyelement` ) → `anyelement`              Computes the *discrete percentile*, the first value within the ordered set of aggregated argument values  whose position in the ordering equals or exceeds the specified *`fraction`*. The aggregated argument must be of a sortable type. | No           |
| `percentile_disc` ( *`fractions`* `double precision[]` ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` `anyelement` ) → `anyarray`              Computes multiple discrete percentiles. The result is an array of the same dimensions as the *`fractions`* parameter, with each non-null element replaced by the input value  corresponding to that percentile. The aggregated argument must be of a  sortable type. | No           |



Each of the “hypothetical-set” aggregates listed in [Table 9.62](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-HYPOTHETICAL-TABLE) is associated with a window function of the same name defined in [Section 9.22](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html). In each case, the aggregate's result is the value that the associated window function would have returned for the “hypothetical” row constructed from *`args`*, if such a row had been added to the sorted group of rows represented by the *`sorted_args`*. For each of these functions, the list of direct arguments given in *`args`* must match the number and types of the aggregated arguments given in *`sorted_args`*. Unlike most built-in aggregates, these aggregates are not strict, that  is they do not drop input rows containing nulls. Null values sort  according to the rule specified in the `ORDER BY` clause.

**Table 9.62. Hypothetical-Set Aggregate Functions**

| Function              Description                            | Partial Mode |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `rank` ( *`args`* ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` *`sorted_args`* ) → `bigint`              Computes the rank of the hypothetical row, with gaps; that is, the row number of the first row in its peer group. | No           |
| `dense_rank` ( *`args`* ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` *`sorted_args`* ) → `bigint`              Computes the rank of the hypothetical row, without gaps; this function effectively counts peer groups. | No           |
| `percent_rank` ( *`args`* ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` *`sorted_args`* ) → `double precision`              Computes the relative rank of the hypothetical row, that is (`rank` - 1) / (total rows - 1). The value thus ranges from 0 to 1 inclusive. | No           |
| `cume_dist` ( *`args`* ) `WITHIN GROUP` ( `ORDER BY` *`sorted_args`* ) → `double precision`              Computes the cumulative distribution, that is (number  of rows preceding or peers with hypothetical row) / (total rows). The  value thus ranges from 1/*`N`* to 1. | No           |

**Table 9.63. Grouping Operations**

| Function              Description                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GROUPING` ( *`group_by_expression(s)`* ) → `integer`              Returns a bit mask indicating which `GROUP BY` expressions are not included in the current grouping set. Bits are  assigned with the rightmost argument corresponding to the  least-significant bit; each bit is 0 if the corresponding expression is  included in the grouping criteria of the grouping set generating the  current result row, and 1 if it is not included. |

The grouping operations shown in [Table 9.63](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#FUNCTIONS-GROUPING-TABLE) are used in conjunction with grouping sets (see [Section 7.2.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html#QUERIES-GROUPING-SETS)) to distinguish result rows. The arguments to the `GROUPING` function are not actually evaluated, but they must exactly match expressions given in the `GROUP BY` clause of the associated query level. For example:

```
=> SELECT * FROM items_sold;
 make  | model | sales
-------+-------+-------
 Foo   | GT    |  10
 Foo   | Tour  |  20
 Bar   | City  |  15
 Bar   | Sport |  5
(4 rows)

=> SELECT make, model, GROUPING(make,model), sum(sales) FROM items_sold GROUP BY ROLLUP(make,model);
 make  | model | grouping | sum
-------+-------+----------+-----

Here, the `grouping` value `0` in the first four rows shows that those have been grouped normally, over both the grouping columns. The value `1` indicates that `model` was not grouped by in the next-to-last two rows, and the value `3` indicates that neither `make` nor `model` was grouped by in the last row (which therefore is an aggregate over all the input rows).
